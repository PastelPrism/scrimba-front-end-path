Hi!ðŸ‘‹

This is the first tiny small project for Scrimba's Front-end Path.
Which I am enjoying a lot so far! ðŸ’š

This README (Also) deserves a lot more attention than it's getting now
But for now, enjoy the message from Scrimba 
It's a pretty great goal they're having

Thank you for your time! 
On to create a to-do list for README's I guess. ðŸ™ƒ

Scrimba's message: 

# Getting Started

```
npm install
npm start
