# 🎉 A place for all the upcoming [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com) projects.   

Hi! 👋   

In **April 2025** I got challenged to do **every web development course** we could find. A challenge I happily accepted. 🎉  
And this project folder is part of this challenge.   

This is the main project folder for all the projects from [Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j). 

## 🎓 Curriculum Overview    

The Frontend Developer Career Path consists of 13 modules with real-life projects, a whole lot of excersizes and so-called Scrims.    
Scrims are videolectures and a place where you can edit in once. It is actually quite fun and useful!      
Anyway, the modules excist of the following projects: 

### **1️⃣ Welcome to the career path** *(Introduction)*  
- No projects

### **2️⃣ Web dev basics** *(HTML / CSS)*  
1. [Build a Personal Website](https://pastelprism.github.io/scrimba-front-end-path/personal-website/) ✔️ (but the challenge isn't finished yet)
2. [Solo Project: Hometown Homepage] 🏗️  

### **3️⃣ Making websites interactive** *(HTML / CSS / JavaScript)*  
1. [Build a passenger counter app] 🏗️     
2. [Solo Project: Basketball Scoreboard] 🏗️    
3. [Solo Project: Password Generator] 🏗️    
4. [Build a Chrome Extension] 🏗️    
5. [Solo Project: Unit Converter] 🏗️   
6. [Solo Project: Build a Mobile App] 🏗️  


Every course comes with **an extra challenge** from one of the teachers who reviews my projects.  
For this one, the one who guides me and reviews my projects through this course, is still thinking about a fun project.   
Most projects will also come with it's own extra challenge and Readme 🥰  

If you think you can help me through all of this, for comments, feedback, to teach or just to cheer me on.

⭐ Thank you and bye! 👋🙂  

**ps: This README isn't finished yet, it's a pretty big course**











This is for now a placeholder.  
Meanwhile, enjoy some little sciences facts: 

💡 Did you know, that a horse generally has more horsepower than juse one?  
It was '93 that a study showed that the maximum power a horse can produce is 18.000W, which is around 24 horsepower. 

Also, every banana is (a bit) radioactive 😱  
But don't worry, they are still healthy, yummy and awesome and won't do you any harm  
It's a potassium-40 thing, a natural isotope. 🥰🍌
